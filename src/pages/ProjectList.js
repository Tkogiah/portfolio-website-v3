        description: "Back in 2014 I made a boardgame and when I was all finished I only ever had one complaint from people `there's too much math`. So now that I know how to code I decided to build this. No this isn't done but it is a working version. This project taught me so much about project management, object oriented programming, algorithms and so many other things. I had so much fun and I even made the music for this!!!",
